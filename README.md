#Personal Portfolio For Kaden! HW2

This is my first portfolio that I completed for week 2's homework.

Here is a sample of how the website will look:

##Lessons learned from the assignment.

>This project taught me quite a bit about how features within a webpage without any logic attached to it functions,
there were many obstacles that forced me to seek out further knowledge on topics to better understand them. Some features were much more difficult to locate and alter. But that was a fresh reminder to keep my code as organized and as clean as possible.

>ALWAYS stay diligent and know that this will all be very much worth it by the end of the course :)
